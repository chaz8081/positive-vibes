# Code Review

When reviewing code, provide thorough, constructive, and actionable feedback.

## Review Checklist

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to?
2. **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
3. **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance issues?
4. **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
5. **Testing**: Is the code adequately tested?
6. **Style**: Does it follow the project's coding conventions?

## Feedback Guidelines

- Be specific: Point to exact lines and suggest alternatives
- Be constructive: Explain WHY something should change, not just WHAT
- Acknowledge good work: Call out things done well
- Prioritize: Distinguish between must-fix issues and nice-to-haves
- Be kind: Remember there's a human on the other side
